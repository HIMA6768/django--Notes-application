    <p class="lead text-secondary mt-4">
        Hi, I’m an enthusiastic AIML engineer with a deep passion for data science, machine learning, and building impactful solutions. I love experimenting with tools like Django, Power BI, and Python to turn raw data into meaningful insights. From backend development to analytical dashboards, I'm always eager to explore new technologies, solve real-world problems, and keep learning cool stuff along the way. Whether it's designing intelligent systems or working on full-stack projects, my goal is to create things that actually matter. This is just the beginning of my journey — and I’m excited for what’s ahead!
    </p>

    <div class="mt-5">
        <h3 class="text-light">More About Me</h3>
        <p class="text-secondary">
            I enjoy collaborating on tech projects, participating in hackathons, and continuously learning. Let’s build something amazing together.
